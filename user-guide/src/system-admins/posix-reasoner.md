# Posix reasoner

WARNING TODO: The [Compute backends](https://wiki.enablingpersonalizedinterventions.nl/user-guide/system-admins/backends/introduction.html) section seems to be missing from this local repository.

TODO: Very high level. General introduction about the posix reasoner. What it is, what its use case is, upsides, downsides, comparison to eFLINT?

TODO: Lower level. Explain policy file, how to set it up, activating the policy (optional: link to posix permission information)

TODO: Optional: Future use case or custom reasoners that could be created similar to this if this one does not fit, mention "Active Directory"-like integrations?.

TODO: Practical. Step by step. Provide example use case, including simple workflow, mapping, etc. How to enable the reasoner to run in Posix mode instead of eFLINT. Potentially take inspiration from this from the existing documentation.
