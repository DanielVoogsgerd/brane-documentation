Welcome to the user guide for the Brane infrastructure!

In this book, we document and outline how to use _Brane_, a programmable application orchestration framework, from a user perspective.

If you want to know more about Brane before you begin, checkout the [overview](./overview.md) chapter. Otherwise, we recommend you to read the [Before you read](./before-reading.md) chapter. It explains how this book is structured, and also goes through some need-to-know terminology.
