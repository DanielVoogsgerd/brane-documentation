# Introduction
In these chapters, we give a specification for the BraneScript Domain-Specific Language (DSL) created for the Brane framework.

Note that it is very technical, but very detailled. It is mostly useful for if you want to develop (something around) the language, or if you want to know some very specific detail for disambiguation. In most other cases, however, it is probably easier to consult the [extended BraneScript tutorial](/user-guide/branescript/introduction.html) in the [Brane: The User Guide](/user-guide) book.

It is recommended that you consult the [conventions](./conventions.md) chapter before reading any other chapter in this series, since that will explain to you some syntax and assumptions made in these chapters.


## Overview
In these chapters, we will discuss the following:
- In the [next chapter](./conventions.md), we will list the conventions that the other chapters use to make them explicit and unambigious. It only lists general conventions, though; some chapters may follow chapter-specific conventions.s
- Then, we will give a formal specification of the [grammar](./grammar.md) (and thus the syntax) of the language, as well as some comments about its design. This is typically only useful if you want to implement some parser for the language yourself.
