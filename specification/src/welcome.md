This book documents the workings of the Brane framework, so it may be maintained easily by future parties or further the understanding of users who want to know exactly what they are working with. Note, however, that this book is not a code documentation, nor is it a user guide; we solely focus on its design. It can be thought of as a kind of informal specification of a Brane framework.

For a how to work with the framework, please check the [Brane: The User Guide](https://wiki.enablingpersonalizedinterventions.nl/user-guide) book: it describes how to work with Brane for all three of the framework's target roles (system engineers, software engineers and scientists).

Code documentation is provided as the automatic documentation generated by Rust. The source code, and instructions on how to generate these docs for the latest version, or for specifics about your architecture/OS, consult the [repository](https://github.com/epi-project/brane). Alternatively, an already-compiled version for an x86-64 Linux built can be found [here](/docs.html).

To start, first head over to the [Overview](./overview.md) page, which talks about Brane in general and how this book will look like. From there, you can select topics that are most of interest.
